# Development Log - Lambda.GraphQL

**Project**: Lambda.GraphQL
**Duration**: January 5-23, 2026
**Total Time**: (n) hours

## Overview

---

## Week 1 (Jan 8) - Project Setup
 - **Afternoon**
   - Repository created
   - initial planning document graphql-hackathon.md created with Kiro discussion - 1hr
     - Used previous experience with Rosyln compiler extensions for project structure and scope
     - Kiro suggested AppSync/GraphQL feature set coverage needed
     - **Decisions**
       - Use Roslyn generator to extract attributes at compile time to generate GraphQL/AppSync metadata
       - Store metadata in an assembly level attribute in generated code.
       - Extract metadata content from generated code at build-time using a MSBuild tool
         **This is required because Roslyn blocks writing non-c# files to disk for security reasons**
       - Use a second output to track resolver functions, readable by CDK at synthesis time.
   - Steering created - 10m
   - Initial project structure created - 10m
   - **Challenges** Adapting to the structure of the hackathon vs previous Kiro usage
 - **Evening**
   - Fixed implementaton gaps in the initial phase - 30m
   - Implemented Resolver tracking and export
   - Verified creation of schema.graphql and resolvers.json
   - **Challenges** Features generated by Kiro CLI ended up skipping important pieces of code using @plan-feature and @execute
     and @code-review wasn't finding the gaps.  Took using Kiro IDE vibe mode to identify gaps and complete the work
 ### Jan 10
  -- **Evening**
   - Planned & Implemented 3rd phase - 1hr
     - Added support for interfaces, unions, custom scalars, subscriptions, field-level auth and relay connection helpers
     - **Decision** Automatic interpretation of UInt64 to AWSTimestamp didn't make sense, transitioned to marker attribute
   - Planned & Implemented documentation. - 30m
     - Created comprehensive documentation and readme based on codebase and graphql-hackathon.md file.
   - Evaluated instructions and project condition for Hackathon, removed output schema files from Git so reviewers can start from a fresh state - 10m
